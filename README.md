# thx-ios-demo
Demo project of how to write iOS test automation.  
  
In this demo, we are going to use https://github.com/tascape/iOS8-Sampler (a folk of https://github.com/shu223/iOS8-Sampler) as test target, please follow its readme to build and run it on your iPhone. (the only change I made was updating bundle id to com.shu223.iOS8SamplerFork)
